Installation instructions:
1. Download this respository.
2. Run `cargo run`.
3. Go to `127.0.0.1:7878` in a browser.

Simply put, I think we should just follow the instructions [here](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch20-01-single-threaded.html) and muddle our way through a web-server that serves _any_ front-end. It'll be really fun to roll it from scratch before switching to another server. 

P.S. Let's pair program for an hour tomorrow!
